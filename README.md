# Wikimplify

Wikimplify provides an easy link when a [Simple English Wikipedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_English_Wikipedia) page exists for an English Wikipedia article.

The name is a combination of "Wikipedia" and "simplify".

## Privacy

Wikimplify will only make requests to wikipedia.org and does not "call home" in any way.

## Known issues

These are some issues I will consider resolving:

- Does not work on mobile (en.m.wikipedia.org)
- Does not link back to en.wikipedia.org (use back button or tabs)
- Cannot toggle behaviour on/off (disable app to stop it from functioning)
